\begin{problem}{Problem 3.7.1}
    Starting on day $n=1$, you buy one lottery ticket each day. Each ticket costs 1 dollar and is independently a winner that can be cashed for 5 dollars with probability $0.1$; otherwise the ticket is worthless. Let $X_n$ equal your \textbf{net profit} after $\mathbf{n}$ days. What is $\E{X_n}$?

    Hint:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What is the PMF ($\P{X}$) and the Expectation ($\E{X}$) of \textbf{one day's} net profit?
        \item What is the relationship between $\E{X}$ and $\E{X_n}$?
    \end{enumerate}
