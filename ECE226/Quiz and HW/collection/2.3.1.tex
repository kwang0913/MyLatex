\begin{problem}{Problem 2.3.1}
    Consider a binary code with 5 bits (0 or 1) in each code word. An example of a code word is 01010. In each code word, a bit is a zero with probability 0.8, independent of any other bit.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What is the probability of the code word 00111?
        \item What is the probability that a code word contains exactly three ones?
    \end{enumerate}
