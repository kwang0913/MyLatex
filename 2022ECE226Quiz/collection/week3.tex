\begin{problem}{Problem 2.3.3}
    Suppose each day that you drive to work a traffic light that you encounter is either green with probability 7/16, red with probability 7/16, or yellow with probability 1/8, independent of the status of the light on any other day. If over the course of five days, G, Y, and R denote the number of times the light is found to be greed, yellow, or red, respectively. What is the probability that $P[G=2, Y=1, R=2]$? Also, what is the probability $P[G=R]$?
